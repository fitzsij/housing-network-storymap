            <section data-place="overview" class="">
                <p>The Irish Housing Network has been set up by a collection of housing and homeless groups fighting this ongoing housing and homeless crisis. We believe in the basic premise that housing is a right that should be provided based on need. We aim to share information, resources and coordinate action with groups across the island. Any group can join if they agree with the principles of the network below.</p>
                <p>PRINCIPLES:
                <ol>

                <li>Housing (long-term and stable, a home) is a right, regardless of income.</li>
                <li>Those affected by housing issues and the communities in which they live, are the centre of the housing struggle, and their consent, participation and leadership is the driving force of the housing struggle.</li>
                <li>Anyone who is a member of a political group, NGO, government body, etc. is welcome in the housing network, but while in the network they are working to empower those affected by the housing crisis, according to the needs and wishes of those affected, not the needs and wishes of their respective party or organisation. In short, political allegiances are left at the door.</li>
                <li>While participating in the housing network, members are subject to the democratic process of the housing network detailed below.</li>
                <li>Violence has no place in the housing network, but all other forms of action, direct or otherwise, are respected when appropriate.</li>
                <li>No member of the housing network can profit financially from those affected by the housing crisis.</li>
                <li>We affirm our belief in solidarity. All groups support and train each other, sharing their skills, experience and knowledge, as well as resources where possible.</li>
                <li>Respect is central to the network. We affirm respect for the individuals and groups, within the network, the space in which we work together and the diverse perspectives and experiences (many of which are difficult and traumatic) of those within the network.</li>
                </ol>
                <i>These eight basic principles must be endorsed and thereafter adhered to if a housing group is to become a participant in the housing network. Violation of these principles can lead to expulsion from the housing network. A contravention of the principles must be outlined in a Y/N format with reference to the principle included. EX. ‘Did this person receive money from a tenant to explain the terms of their lease? (principle 6) Y/N?’ For violations of principles a +50% vote decides the issue.</i></p>
                <p>DEMANDS
                        <ul>
                        <li>No Evictions</li>

                        <li>Housing Based On Need</li>

                        <li>Tenants Protection</li>

                        <li>Squatting Rights</li>

                        <li>Homelessness</li>

                        <li>Housing as part of the Community</li>
                        </ul>

                North Dublin Bay Housing Crisis Community was set up in 2013 by people to fight for Coolock & Darndale housing rights

                <p><a href="http://irishhousingnetwork.org/?p=143&preview=true">With lots of highs and lows over the past year, here’s a recap of what North Dublin Bay Housnig Crisis Community has been up to. From an impromptu meeting with the previous Lord Mayor to our occupation and re-opening of the Bolt Hostel on Bolton Street to highlight the neglect of vacant properties, from banner drops to occupying Dublin City Council offices until they committed to providing support for children previously turned away, it’s been busy. Unfortunately, it looks like there’ll be plenty more to keep us busy. <br><br>

                We have sadly realised after occupying the civic centre in Coolock that people power is the only voice that gets listened to. We have provided support for people taking cases to the PRTB, we’ve taken our support group to see the much talked about but little thought about modular units, we’ve made a presentation to Dublin City Council on behalf of homeless and struggling families; and 2016 will not be the year we slow down. Here’s a breakdown of how we spent last year, expect even more this year.</a></p>

                We would like to thank everybody for their incredible support of the Bolt Hostel. But tomorrow might be its last day.
                <br><br>
                By court order, the Bolt Hostel will be undergoing a fire safety inspection tomorrow at 11 o’clock in the morning. This could be the excuse needed to immediately shut us down. This could be the last day the Bolt Hostel is open to homeless families in desperate need of accommodation.
                <br><br>
                If you believe that it is wrong that vacant, public buildings cannot be used to shelter those most in need, please make your presence felt outside the Bolt Hostel. We need the media and the council to see that this project has public support.
                <br><br>
                This is a peaceful, respectful show of solidarity with the homeless and those in need. Everyone welcome.

                Dublin central runs a weekly support group every Friday at 11am-1pm in hardwicke street community centre . Pop in for a tea and a chat</p>
                <div class="youtube-player" data-id="4SmFN6VkVnI"></div>

                <p>Dublin Central Housing Action formed out of the Bolt Hostel. After 3 months in the Bolt Hostel on Bolton Street we were finally taken to the High Court and Evicted. A community had grown out of our actions in the Bolt, and we felt it was time to build on that.
                <br><br>
                Central to all our work has been the set up of a Support Group for anyone facing homelessness or housing problems. The support group meets every Friday morning 11-1. It aims to see those affected leading and supporting each other. Countless people have come to the support group, the great injustices of the housing system laid bare, rough sleepers, those facing emergency accomadation closures, families in BnB's, overcrowding, damp and mold, rent hikes and eviction notices. All can be tackled, all are stronger supporting each other and fighting together.
                <br><br>
                <br><br>If you have a housing problem or are facing homelessness get in touch.<br><br>
                If you want to organise in your own community we will support you.
                <br><br>If you are interested in any of the three things we are working on, support group, direct action or land, or if you have a new idea we are happy to see what we can do

                <p>This was in the area of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/D8HAC-1461777794063452"> D8 Housing Action</a></p>
                <p>
                    Following a 12-day occupation at Catherines Gate and 9 days before Christmas, the Reddington family have accepted a compromised offer from Dublin City Council. It is a bittersweet compromise for the Reddington family and father Ray who has been occupying Catherines Gate in protest of the family's sudden eviction. When they were first evicted, in the middle of Storm Desmond, DCC offered the family two separate rooms which would cause the parents to split up their family, with one parent taking a child each. This offer was also insecure, with no guarantee that the family would not be evicted over the Christmas period.
                    <br><br>

                    For the family this will be a bittersweet Christmas. They have achieved much through a 12 day occupation, and in putting their head above the parapet have shown enormous bravery in the face of desperate conditions. The Irish Housing Network and D8HAC will keep the pressure on DCC that they fall through on their words and there is no more mistreatment of the family. Tomorrow the family ask everyone to join Ray as he comes out of Catherines Gate and show him support from 2pm.

                    <br><br>

                    For Catherine's Gate and the tenants, this is not over. The Irish Housing Network intend to further investigate and make public information on the business dealings of management, the stench of low level property speculation and high end investment deals. We will also be supporting former and current tenants face down any further mistreatment with the wider aim of tenants' rights for in emergency accommodation.

                    <br><br>

                    *Catherine's Gate has lead to a stream of reports to us of homelessness and housing difficulties in D8/D12. D8HAC have set up a support group which will start this friday 11-1. Please contact D8HAC for more detail.

                    <br><br>

                    There will be much more organising in D8/D12, across Dublin and across the Country. The issues are not going away - this government has embarked on the most right wing housing policy for a generation. The homeless crisis is not going away. Social housing is being all but eliminated, housing is being used to divide between the most vulnerable from the working poor, the middle class & renting class from the property owners and the investors and developers on top. This cannot solve the need for housing. The markets can and will not provide..

                <p>The aim of this is to provide a safe and friendly space for people who are facing housing difficulties to come together and discuss them in an open and supportive environment. Facing a housing crisis is a very stressful thing to be experiencing but you are certainly not alone.
                <br><br>

                We will have facilitators there who can share information on issues such as
                - What to do if you are at risk of homelessness
                - Understanding HAP (Housing Assistance Payment)
                - Tenants rights and PRTB
                - Rent increases and other relevant issues.
                <br><br>

                We are very clearly stating that we are not a housing authority who can provide social houses nor do we provide housing services. Our aim is to provide the information and the tools to empower people to help themselves and others out of this housing crisis.
                <br><br>

                As members of The Irish Housing Network, we hope to continue to build links with other housing action groups in communities across the country to collectively campaign for housing as a right which should be provided based on need.
                <br><br>

                Please come along to Newbridge Family Resource Centre on Tuesday at 2pm or Thursday at 7.45pm for a friendly informal introduction. Also if you feel that you have knowledge or experience that could help or positively contribute in some way, you are more than welcome to Join the discussion.

                <p>In the last few months housing groups, through the Irish Housing Network, have worked to help a large number of people. This has included; A lone parent and her two young children who, after becoming homeless, were connected to the appropriate housing and community services and who are now in rented accommodation; a lone parent and her child who has a disability who remained in their home after an illegal eviction was stopped; working to stop repossession orders on homes in court and signposting people to housing and community services information so that they can be informed of their rights and how to access services they might need. These are only a handful of the countless examples in a crisis that is growing, not being solved.
                <br><br>

                The Irish Housing Network supports all housing issues and fight backs against the crisis and are actively linking in with a wide range of groups. We see the crisis of homeless as part of a wider housing crisis, of eviction, rental hikes, rental insecurity, inadequate support, disintegration of communities, mortgage debt and a detriment of available, quality and affordable housing. At the root of all of this is housing policy and power vested in greed and wealth instead of provision based on need. We will not stand by as people are forced into further despair. We are here to fight back.
                <br><br>
                This Thursday June 18th at 2.00pm, The Irish Housing Network, housing activists, supporters and those affected by the Housing Crisis will be gather at the GPO. We will then prepare for an action in support of everyone effected by the housing crisis. We invite anyone to attend in support and for all media to report and highlight our action and this crisis.</p>

                <p>Ireland in 2016 is in the grip of a devastating housing crisis. There are over 6500 people officially counted as homeless, with many more falling between the cracks. Over a third of these people are children, who are forced to spend the most formative and vulnerable time in their lives in a state of terrifying desperation. Rents are higher than they have ever been in the history of the republic and they continue to rise, while the most recent census counted over a quarter of a million empty houses around the country. The government’s solution has been to subsidize developers and landlords.
                <br><br>

                Ireland is not unique in this. In France, rising rents have led to over 13,000 police-attended evictions a year. In Spain, between 2008 and 2015 there were over 600,000 foreclosures and 400,000 evictions. A lack of individual bankruptcy laws has meant that after auction at a hugely reduced price, the ex-owner still owes a huge un-cancelled debt, as do the guarantors who are often family members. In Poland, homeless people are fined for rough sleeping.
                <br><br>

                Across Europe, the same processes are having the same effects. The privatisation of social housing has left people abandoned by the state, and forced into a volatile housing market that has no place for them. Increased prices are seen by governments across the continent as a way of feeding the economy and ending recession, as the majority are forced to grow more ever more indebted to landlords. Everywhere, the right to housing is under constant and ruthless attack. Across Europe too, there is resistance.
                <br><br>

                In Spain, the Platform for People Affected by Mortgages or Platforma de Adectados por lat Hipoteca (PAH) holds assemblies that provide knowledge and support, and through direct actions; blocks evictions and occupies empty buildings. There are over 240 chapters across the country. In France, the Right to Housing or Droit Au Logement (DAL) fights across 25 cities to resist evictions, and keep people in the neighbourhoods they are being forced out of. In Portugal, Habita gives legal support to families facing housing difficulty, and publicly argues fiercely for the right to housing.
